If you would like to re-create the analysis made they are produced in R based on data collected using a Tilt Hydrometer. The [Tilt Hydromoter](https://tilthydrometer.com/) is paired with a Raspberry Pi (with [Tilt Pi](https://tilthydrometer.com/products/tilt-pi-raspberry-pi-disk-image-download)) to record the data.

This is the data used to create the plots for each brewing session.
